        /* Naming Conventions

In Java, it's important to follow naming conventions to keep your code readable and maintainable. Here are some key rules:

Variable Names:
    Use camelCase: Start with a lowercase letter, then capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word (e.g., firstName, studentCount).
    Choose descriptive names that indicate the variable's purpose (e.g., userAge instead of ua).
    Avoid single-letter names except for simple loop counters.
Constant Names:
    Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: Write in uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores (e.g., MAX_VALUE, PI_VALUE).
    Use for values that don't change throughout the program.
General Rules:
    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must start with a letter, an underscore _, or a dollar sign $.
    Names are case-sensitive (myVariable is different from myvariable).
    Avoid using Java's reserved keywords (like int, class, public, etc.).*/
